### Scheme Interpreter

----------  

A super-simple fun project (written TDD style) which “compiles” one-line Scheme expressions to Python. In the spirit of Scheme minimalism (:wink:), this program only handles `lambda`, `define`, `let`, `+`, and `-`.

For a good time, run: ```python interpreter.py```.
